##Connecting the programmatic user community

Europe PMC makes its open access content and metadata available for building new applications. With a [developer tab](http://europepmc.org/developers) specially designed for programmatic users and with detailed documentation, the aim is to make it easy to integrate Europe PMC APIs into new services and thereby improve life science research.

Programmatic users can now flag the applications they have created using Europe PMC APIs in the newly released [API use cases page](http://europepmc.org/use-cases). This new page aims to foster interaction within the Europe PMC API user community, connecting programmatic users and allowing them to share their work and improve the usability of their open source code.

Do read these testimonials and see what nuggets you can glean from other users. If you have pearls of wisdom to pass on or would simply like to flag your integration and membership of this user community, please contact us on [helpdesk@europepmc.org](mailto:helpdesk@europepmc.org).
